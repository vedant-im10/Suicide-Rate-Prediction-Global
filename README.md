# 📊 Suicide Rate Prediction: Machine Learning Analysis

This project uses **Machine Learning** to predict suicide rates based on various socio-economic and demographic factors. By analyzing data from sources like the **World Health Organization**, **World Bank**, and **Human Development Index**, it aims to identify key drivers of suicide rates and offer insights for mental health interventions.

## 🌟 Project Overview

Suicide is a major global issue, with nearly **800,000 people dying by suicide each year**. This project builds predictive models to understand the factors contributing to suicide and to identify high-risk groups. The goal is to support policymakers and mental health professionals create effective preventive strategies.

## 🔍 Key Features

- **Predictive Modeling**: Used **Decision Tree**, **Random Forest**, and **XGBoost** models to forecast suicide rates based on gender, age, and GDP per capita.
- **Comparative Analysis**: Compared suicide rates across countries to highlight high-risk regions and demographic groups.
- **Data Visualization**: Created visualizations to illustrate trends and patterns in the data.
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Identified the socio-economic factors contributing to suicide rates, offering insights for intervention.

## 🧬 Methodology

1. **Data Collection**: Combined data from multiple sources, including WHO and the UN.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned data, handled missing values, and converted categorical variables to numerical form.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Analyzed trends and correlations to understand factors affecting suicide rates.
4. **Feature Engineering**: Developed new features, like the "Economic Stress Index", to capture relevant factors.
5. **Model Training**: Used **Decision Tree**, **Random Forest**, and **XGBoost** models to predict suicide rates.
6. **Evaluation**: Assessed model performance using **R-squared**, **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**, and **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**.

## 📊 Key Insights

- **Global Trends**: Increasing suicide rates in countries like **Russia**, **Japan**, and the **US**.
- **Demographic Patterns**: Older generations, especially those exposed to traumatic events, showed higher suicide rates.
- **Key Factors**: **Financial stress** and **mental health issues** are significant drivers of suicide rates.

## 🔬 Outcomes and Impact

- **Data-Driven Decision Making**: Provides a clear understanding of suicide trends, helping policymakers make informed decisions.
- **Policy Implications**: The project highlights the need for targeted mental health support and economic reforms to reduce suicide rates.
- **Global Awareness**: Emphasizes the need for international cooperation to address this issue.

## 🚀 Future Work

- **Enhanced Models**: Explore **Neural Networks** and other advanced models for better accuracy.
- **Real-Time Dashboard**: Create a real-time dashboard for suicide rate predictions.
- **Expand Dataset**: Include more recent data and broader demographic variables for a comprehensive model.
