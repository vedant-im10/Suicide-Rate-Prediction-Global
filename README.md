# 📊 Suicide Rate Prediction: Leveraging Machine Learning to Combat a Global Crisis

**_"Using Advanced Machine Learning Models to Predict and Analyze Suicide Rates Worldwide"_**

This repository contains a comprehensive Machine Learning project focused on predicting suicide rates based on socio-economic and demographic factors. By analyzing global data from the World Health Organization, World Bank, Human Development Index, and more, this project aims to identify the key drivers of suicide rates and provide actionable insights to inform mental health interventions.

## 🌟 Project Motivation

Every year, approximately 800,000 people die by suicide, making it one of the leading causes of death worldwide. The project aims to address this pressing issue by building predictive models that help understand the underlying causes of suicide and identify at-risk groups. By predicting future trends and analyzing historical data, the project aims to support policymakers, mental health professionals, and communities in creating targeted preventive measures.

## 🔍 Key Features

- **🧠 Predictive Modeling**: Implements Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Regression, and XGBoost Regression to forecast suicide rates based on factors like gender, age, GDP per capita, and generation.
- **📊 Comparative Analysis**: Compares suicide rates across countries, identifying high-risk regions and demographic groups.
- **📈 Data Visualization**: Provides insightful visualizations to illustrate trends, patterns, and the distribution of suicide rates globally.
- **🔑 Root Cause Analysis**: Highlights the socio-economic and demographic factors contributing to the increasing suicide rates, offering data-driven insights for intervention strategies.

## 🧬 Methodology

1. **Data Collection**: Combined data from multiple sources, including the World Health Organization, World Bank, Human Development Index, Kaggle, and the United Nations Development Program, to create a robust dataset.
   
2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handled missing data and removed irrelevant features, ensuring data quality and consistency.
   - Converted categorical variables into numerical forms using one-hot encoding and scaled data to enhance model performance.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Analyzed trends, correlations, and outliers in the data to identify key factors influencing suicide rates.
   - Created visualizations such as world maps and line plots to illustrate the geographic and temporal distribution of suicide rates.

4. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Developed new features, such as "Economic Stress Index" and "Generational Impact Score," to capture complex socio-economic pressures.
   
5. **Model Training and Evaluation**:
   - **Algorithms**: Implemented Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost Regression models to handle continuous data.
   - **Evaluation Metrics**: Used R-squared, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to evaluate model performance.

6. **Visualization**:
   - Used Seaborn, Matplotlib, and GeoPandas to create detailed visualizations of the analysis results, showing trends, risk factors, and model predictions.

## 📊 Key Insights

- **Global Trends**: The analysis revealed rising suicide rates globally, with significant spikes in certain countries such as Russia, Japan, and the United States.
- **Demographic Disparities**: Higher suicide rates were observed among older generations, particularly those who lived through traumatic events such as wars.
- **Top Contributing Factors**: Key drivers include financial stress, mental health issues, and socio-cultural factors, highlighting the need for targeted mental health support and economic reforms.

## 🔬 Outcomes and Impact

- **Data-Driven Decision Making**: The project provides a data-backed understanding of suicide trends, aiding mental health professionals and policymakers in crafting effective prevention strategies.
- **Policy Implications**: Insights can guide the development of focused policies, such as financial assistance programs for at-risk populations, mental health awareness campaigns, and community support systems.
- **Global Awareness**: Highlights the critical need for international cooperation to address the root causes of suicide and implement preventive measures globally.

## 🚀 Future Directions

- **Enhanced Models**: Explore more advanced algorithms like Neural Networks and Ensemble Methods to improve accuracy and predictive power.
- **Real-Time Analysis Tool**: Develop an interactive dashboard for real-time suicide rate predictions, accessible to researchers and decision-makers.
- **Broader Scope**: Expand the dataset to include more recent data, additional demographic variables, and a wider range of countries to create a more comprehensive and adaptable model.
